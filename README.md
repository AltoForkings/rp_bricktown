# Welcome to Bricktown.

## Context
rp_bricktown is inspired by the Garry's Mod DarkRP map "rp_downtown_v4c_v2", which was by large & by far the most popular Garry's Mod DarkRP map. 

Despite Downtown's popularity, the map has some glaring faults. It wasn't built using any best-practices, has many odd inconsistincies, and suffers from poor optimization for a map of it's size and detail.

My solution is to build a derivative work from scratch, mostly preserving the layout while pretty much re-doing everything else.

## Map Edits & .VMF file.
I invite people to fork the project & make their own versions!

I provide the .VMF file, so that individuals can  put their unique spin on it with new areas, buildings, optimizations, or smaller server-specific edits like putting their group logo on PD or something. 

I leave it up to them, as long as they comply with the included CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0 license.
