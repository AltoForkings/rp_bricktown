# Welcome to Bricktown.

## Description:
rp_bricktown is a Garry's Mod DarkRP map inspired by rp_downtown, and it's derivative work rp_downtown_v4c_v2, which was by large & by far the most popular map for the gamemode. 
Despite rp_downtown_v4c_v2's popularity, the map has some glaring faults. It wasn't built using any best-practices, has many odd inconsistencies, and suffers from poor optimization for a map of it's size and detail.

Five years ago, I figured my solution would be to build a derivative work of my own, from scratch, preserving certain aspects of the layout of rp_downtown while filling in the rest with original work. 
Over time, rp_bricktown has taken on an identity and charm of it's own, and I'm incredibly proud of the result. 
While I never expect rp_bricktown to reach the same popularity as other successful rp_downtown derivatives, I'm incredibly grateful for the thousands(!!!) who've downloaded and checked out the map throughout it's development, it's y'all that have made it all worthwhile :^))

## Map Edits & .VMF file.
I invite people to fork the project & make their own versions!

I provide the .VMF file, so that individuals can  put their unique spin on it with new areas, buildings, optimizations, or smaller server-specific edits like putting their group logo on PD or something. 

I leave it up to them, as long as they comply with the CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0 license!

## License Notes
The Creative Commons license only covers the .VMF file, the design of the map itself, and models and textures created by me, Softboi Mark.
